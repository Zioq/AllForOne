# AllForOneApp (Android Mobile App Developement Project)

## Overview for this app
When we started to think about the topic for our project, all the members wanted to create an application that would help people, then we realized that Canada has a lot of homeless people.

As we study homeless issues, we conclude that an app with information from homeless centers will be very productive for homeless people. Our application provides quick access to information and various functions can reduce your suffering.

Our purpose is to provide updated and fast information to people through a mobile application. Cell phones are an indispensable object for people, so we can help a large number of people with our all-in-one application.
